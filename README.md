# HTTP Server, From Scratch in C

TO DO:
- ~~Server should listen and accept connections from singular HTTP client one at a time~~
- Server should print out raw strings from singular HTTP client (chat style)
    - ~~IPC (Unix domain)~~
    - ~~Local host (IPV4)~~
    - True internet (IPV4)
- Server should handle simple request from client, e.g. `GET / HTTP/1.1` and respond with compliant HTTP response
